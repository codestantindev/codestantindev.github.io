{<h1 className="text-center text-4xl tracking-tighter font-extrabold md:text-5xl mt-8">Rules</h1>}

## 1. Follow Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This is a catch-all rule. We base our rules on these guidelines. Breaking these rules will lead to a permanent ban.
</Callout>

<ChevronMenu title="1.1. You must be at least 13 years old to be on Discord" openstate={false}>
Discord requires you to be at least 13 to use the platform, if you say you are younger, you will be banned. This includes joking about your age.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.2. Don’t use self-bots, nitro snipers, auto changing statuses, API exploits, or do anything that harms Discord’s servers" openstate={false}>
Discussing these topics is a bit touchy. If you say you did these things before or you are currently doing them, then you will be punished.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Sending IP loggers will fall under a ban as well.
</Callout>
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.3. Don’t execute or joke about organizing raids or doxxes" openstate={false}>
If you are suggesting that people raid or doxx someone, you will be punished.
**If you share someone’s doxx, you are also doxxing them and will get banned.**

_Note: You can talk about how a server got raided or someone got mass harassed. We just ask you to not encourage the behavior._
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.4. Don’t use Discord to scam or send malware / viruses" openstate={false}>
If you are found to be doing this **inside and even outside the server**, you will be permanently banned.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.5 Do not leak private information" openstate={false}>
We do not allow any personal information to be sent into the server. This will include: IPs, Addresses, Phone numbers, Legal names, as well any other identifiable information.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Giving out fake information will also lead to a ban.
</Callout>
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="1.6 Recording VCs is not tolerated" openstate={false}>
We will not accept any cases that you make against someone due to a VC recording. Discord abides by California state law, and so do you under their TOS.
We ask that before you attempt to record any VC, you ask permission from each individual person. Should you not abide by that, you will be banned.
</ChevronMenu>

## 2. No NSFW Content / Gore / Being Horny

<ChevronMenu title="2.1. Don’t talk about NSFW content" openstate={false}>
Talking about sex (or any other sexual activity), genitals, kinks, fanfiction, 
or any other content meant to inflict arousal will lead to moderation.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.2. No NSFL or gore content" openstate={false}>
Videos or content that is NSFL (not safe for life, or things that nobody wants to see), or discussion about these topics, is strictly prohibited.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.3. Don’t e-date or try to flirt with someone" openstate={false}>
Do not flirt with people, this is not a fucking dating server.
We also have minors on our server and it’s a recipe for disaster.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.4. Don’t send any bait or cropped or suggestive NSFW content" openstate={false}>
Photos that look like nudity / pornography / gore but are instead like a normal tree or an optical illusion are not allowed.

Cropping out, blurring with pixels, or censoring NSFW content will result in punishment.

Sending suggestive poses of people having intercourse or any other NSFW content will result in punishment.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.5. Don’t send any form of pornography or nudity, or gore" openstate={false}>
Any photos, videos, ascii art, emotes, gifs of nudity or pornography or gore will result in a permanent ban.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="2.6. Don’t sexualize minors or joke about it" openstate={false}>
I do not care if you are 14 and you are calling a 14 year old actress hot.
I do not care that you are sending a joke about owning a large amount of CP.
We have a zero tolerance policy for sexualizing minors.

**_This includes flirting with minors. So, if you break rule 2.3 and flirt with someone and they turn out to be a minor, you are going to be banned._**
</ChevronMenu>

## 3. Be Respectful to All Members

<ChevronMenu title="3.1. Don’t troll, be toxic, cause arguments, or be rude to members" openstate={false}>

It’s impossible to list every single way someone could break this rule but if we catch you trying to be an edgelord, you will be punished.

**_If you want to talk about sensitive topics with someone, please take it to DMs._**
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="3.2 Don’t be racist, sexist, send death threats, or engage in hate speech" openstate={false}>

While we know people can joke about death threats, unfortunately in the age of the internet and the scale of the server, we do not care about the context of your message.
**Even if you are trying to pass it off as a joke, we do not allow any racist, sexist, hate speech, or death threats whatsoever on the server.**

**_Don’t know why we need to say this, but yes, having a swastika on your profile is hate speech. And yes, roleplaying as Hitler is not allowed._**

## 4. Don’t Spam / Be Annoying

<ChevronMenu title="4.1. Don’t Spam in VC or Chat" openstate={false}>
Spamming reactions, messages, emotes, walls of text, zalgo text, newlines, and pings in chat is prohibited. Spamming new posts in form channels, or spamming tickets is prohibited as well.

**_Do not use spoilers to pretend to bypass automod. Do not pretend to bypass automod either, that’s called spoiler baiting._**

Using a soundboard, screeching / yelling, quickly joining and leaving a voice call is prohibited.
</ChevronMenu>

<ChevronMenu title="4.2. Don’t Be Annoying" openstate={false}>
If someone is asking you to stop, or you are getting on people’s nerves, please respect their boundaries and step back.

If you are asking everyone to shut-up, you are the annoying one. Read the room.
</ChevronMenu>

</ChevronMenu>

## 9. Don’t Bypass Automod

Attempting to bypass automod will result in you getting punished for the rule you broke **and we will be stricter than usual**.

## 10. Don’t Find Loopholes in the Rules

No rules list is completely cohesive. If you feel like you’ve been treated unfairly by a moderator, please report it to an admin.

If you feel like you’ve been treated unfairly by an admin, DM No Text To Speech.

**_If you intentionally are finding loopholes or misreporting abuse to staff, you will be punished accordingly._**
